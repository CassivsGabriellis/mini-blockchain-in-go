## Blockchain transaction system made in Go

This program aims to demonstrate, in a local and simplified manner for practical reasons, how the transaction structure of a blockchain works.

It implements a basic blockchain structure with proof-of-work mining to create a secure and tamper-resistant ledger. It prints the information of the block's hash, previous hash, timestamp, proof-of-work value, and data.
